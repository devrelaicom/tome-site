# Plugins & catalogs

A **catalog** is a git repository of plugins that you add once. Tome clones
and indexes it. A **plugin** is a bundle of skills, commands, agents, and
hooks inside a catalog. You enable the plugins you want. Day-to-day, Tome is
mostly these two actions — add catalogs, enable plugins — and everything else
(search, harness config, the MCP server) follows from what you have enabled.

## Add a catalog

```bash
tome catalog add devrelaicom/midnight-expert-tome
```

Tome clones the repository, parses every plugin manifest it finds, and
registers the catalog under a short name — here `midnight-expert`, thirteen
plugins in a single add. Inspect what was added:

```bash
tome catalog show midnight-expert
```

  midnight-wallet        midnight-wallet
```

(Output abridged — the full listing also shows the catalog's source URL and
last sync time.)

Adding a catalog enables nothing by itself. The thirteen plugins are now
available, but none of them is enabled, and none of them takes up space in
any context window.

## Enable a plugin

```bash
tome plugin enable midnight-verify
```

Enabling parses the plugin's entries — skills, commands, agents — and indexes
them for [search](./search.md). Check the current state:

```bash
tome plugin list
```

```

One plugin is enabled: 19 skills, 2 commands, and 7 agents — 28 entries
indexed and searchable. The other twelve plugins stay disabled and cost
nothing until you enable them.

### Variations

- `tome plugin show <name>` prints one plugin's entries, grouped by kind with
  per-entry annotations — useful before deciding whether to enable it.
- `tome plugin disable <name>` reverses this: the plugin's entries are removed
  from the index, and your harnesses drop them on the next sync.
- Bare `tome plugin` opens an interactive picker — catalog → plugin → action —
  useful when you want to pick from a list instead of typing names.

## Update catalogs

```bash
tome catalog update midnight-expert
```

This pulls the catalog's source repository and re-indexes it. Run it when the
catalog publishes new plugins or updated skills; your enabled plugins receive
the changes.

## Remove a catalog

```bash
tome catalog remove midnight-expert
```

If the catalog still has enabled plugins, removal fails (exit `53`), because
your harnesses still use those entries. Pass `--force` to cascade:
every enabled plugin is disabled first, then the catalog is removed.

## Catalogs to add today

**Midnight Expert** is the main catalog from the Midnight Foundation: a
collection of AI plugins for building, testing, and verifying
[Compact](https://docs.midnight.network) smart contracts on
[Midnight](https://midnight.network) — privacy patterns, formal verification,
devnet tooling, and more, available across every harness Tome supports.

```bash
tome catalog add devrelaicom/midnight-expert-tome
tome plugin enable midnight-expert
```

The catalog bundles **13 plugins** covering the Compact development lifecycle,
including:

- Compact language and standard-library guidance
- Privacy and disclosure patterns
- Formal verification and code review
- dApp and SDK development
- Local devnet and tooling

The verification plugin alone — `midnight-verify` — contains **19 skills,
2 commands, and 7 agents**: 28 searchable entries from a single
`plugin enable`.

Once the plugin is enabled, configure a harness:

```bash
tome harness use claude-code
```

and search for what you need:

```bash
tome query "verify a Compact contract"
```

See [Quickstart](../getting-started/quickstart.md) for the full flow and
[Search](./search.md) for how retrieval works.

## Pitfalls

| Exit code | What happened | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `4` | Catalog already added. | Use `tome catalog update <name>` to refresh it instead of re-adding. |
| `21` | Plugin already in the requested state. | Nothing — it was already enabled (or disabled). Check `tome plugin list`. |
| `53` | Catalog removal refused: it still has enabled plugins. | Disable them, or re-run `tome catalog remove <name> --force` to cascade. |
| `80` | Plugin not converted: a legacy `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` exists but no `tome-plugin.toml`. | Convert it — see [Converting](../authoring/convert.md). |

The full table is in the [exit codes reference](../reference/exit-codes.md).

## Where next

- [Search](./search.md) — find the right entry by meaning, not by name.
- [Harnesses](./harnesses.md) — write your enabled plugins to each agent's
  native config.
- [Converting](../authoring/convert.md) — already have plugins in another
  format? Convert them instead of rewriting them.

# Linting

Before you publish a catalog — or enable one you just converted — you want a
clear answer: what is malformed, what is lossy, and what will misbehave at
read time. `tome {catalog,plugin,skill} lint <path>` reads a Tome artifact and
reports findings. It never modifies files unless you pass `--autofix`, and it
never stops partway through a run.

## Worked example

Lint the converted `midnight-expert-tome` catalog from the
[converting](./convert.md) walkthrough:

```console
$ tome catalog lint ~/catalogs/midnight-expert-tome
[warning] lint/residual-harness-ism: shell-execution injection (`` !`cmd` ``) is not supported — Tome does not execute commands in bodies (…/midnight-expert-tome/compact-core/skills/compact-core:compact-language-ref/SKILL.md)
[warning] lint/description-too-long: entry `compact-dev` description is 2557 characters (max 1024) (…/midnight-expert-tome/compact-core/agents/compact-dev.md)
[warning] lint/residual-harness-ism: file-reference injection (`@path`) is not supported — Tome does not inject file contents (…/midnight-expert-tome/midnight-verify/skills/midnight-verify:verify-by-execution/SKILL.md)
  …
Summary: 0 error(s), 18 warning(s), 0 info(s)
```

*(Excerpt — 18 warnings in the full run; paths shortened here.)*

Each finding is one line: a severity (`error`, `warning`, `info`), a rule id,
a message, and the offending file. The `Summary` line at the end always
appears — see below.

## Lint never halts

A malformed artifact is a *finding*, not a crash. A broken manifest or
unparseable frontmatter becomes a finding against that file, and lint
continues with the rest of the tree. You always get the complete report and
the `Summary` line — never a stack trace partway through, and never a report
that silently stopped at the first bad file.

## `--autofix`

`--autofix` applies the mechanically-safe fixes — rewritable harness-isms,
making an entry's `name` match its directory — then re-lints and repeats until
nothing changes (a fixpoint), reporting what it fixed and what still needs
manual edits. It does not apply fixes that require judgment: an over-long
description is flagged, not truncated.

Add `--dry-run` to see what `--autofix` *would* change without writing
anything. (Plain `lint` already writes nothing — `--dry-run` only has an
effect together with `--autofix`.)

```bash
tome catalog lint ~/catalogs/midnight-expert-tome --autofix --dry-run
```

## Verdicts and CI

Lint's exit code is a verdict:

| Exit | Verdict |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Clean — or warnings only, without `--strict` |
| `85` | At least one error found |
| `86` | Warnings found under `--strict` (and no errors) |

Without `--strict`, warnings are advisory and the exit code stays `0`. With
`--strict`, warnings fail too — which is exactly what you want in CI:

```yaml
- run: tome catalog lint . --strict
  # exit 85 = errors found, 86 = warnings under --strict, 0 = clean
```

Run this before tagging a release, and unconverted content never reaches your
users. The full code table lives in the
[exit code reference](../reference/exit-codes.md).

## Pitfalls

- **Warnings don't fail by default.** A pipeline that gates on lint's exit
  code passes a catalog full of warnings unless you pass `--strict`.
- **`85` and `86` are verdicts, not crashes.** Don't retry them; read the
  findings. A genuinely broken invocation fails with a different code — see
  the [exit code reference](../reference/exit-codes.md).
- **`--autofix` applies only mechanical fixes.** Residual injections (`@path`,
  shell execution) and over-long descriptions stay flagged until you edit the
  files yourself.

## Next steps

- [Converting](./convert.md) — where most lint warnings come from.
- [Creating](./create.md) — scaffolds are lint-clean by construction.
- [Distributing](./distributing.md) — `lint --strict` belongs in your CI
  before you tag.
